                    <h5>Mechatronics Engineer · 
                        Designer · Computational Geometry Expert · Web Developer
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        What moves me is to design technologies that augment human capabilities and defy the boundaries of what seems impossible. 
                        I graduated in mechatronics engineering from USP, interned at the University of Tokyo, 
                        and worked on biotech companies as Galy and Tissuelabs, developing disruptive technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides my passion for engineering and design, I am fascinated by geometry. 
                        Geometry is a powerful tool that enables the reconstruction of virtual models of the world. 
                        The virtual world is boundless. With the proper devices, 
                        we can interface it with our reality and create a perception that something magical is happening. 
                        For instance, we can model an organoid in the computer and 3D print it; 
                        look at cells in virtual reality and feel like we have shrunk; and see the inside of a car without opening it with X-ray CT.
                    </p>

                        Tissuelabs is a tissue engineering startup. The company's dream was to manufacture an artificial transplantable heart. 
                        Lucas proposed the first organ-on-a-chip produced by the company using stereolithography 3D printers. 
                        Organ-on-a-chip is an organ model that simulates activities, mechanics, and physiological response. 
                        The model has a 3D microfluidic circuit integrated with a cell culture. 
                        Each channel can represent blood vessels and other parts of the human body. 
                        For instance, an alveoli model is basically an air sac and a network of blood vessels around the sac.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Lucas was responsible for designing and testing most organ-on-a-chip and microfluidics 3D models at Tissuelabs. 
                        He developed more than 50 different models - 
                        used by scientists to conduct experiments and also used by the company to showcase the equipment's capabilities.

                                The main product at Tissuelabs were 3D printers. 
                                Lucas was responsible for developing a software to interact with the printer. 
                                The software was developed using javascript and was hosted on a remote server, 
                                eliminating the need to install a software and solving compatibility problems. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The software has integration with slic3r and with the 3D printer. The user can convert different format 3D models - 
                                stl, obj, ply, etc - into gcode. The web app can 3D print with multiple bio inks and even mix different concentration of inks. 
                                Lucas also adapted the printer as an automatic pipette machine by developing a pipette mode in the software.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Finally, Lucas developed CAD software to generate organ-on-a-chip 3D models based on a 2D drawing made by the user. 
                                The user had two tools available: The first tool can draw the object contour. The second tool draws the vessels' path.

                                Tissuelabs produced bioinks - an extra-cellular matrix extracted from animal and vegetal sources. 
                                Lucas developed two low-cost bioreactors used in the bioink production process. 
                                Lucas was also responsible for fixing lab equipment such as bag sealers, magnetic stirrers, bioreactors, autoclave, 
                                3D printers, and centrifuges.

                        Galy is a cellular agriculture company. Cell agg can produce differente plant culture using less water, energy, land, and chemicals.
                        The company wanted to convey an urgency sentiment to investors to convince
                        them to join the cause. Lucas co-produced a VR video and filmed the documentary in the Chapada dos Guimaraes national park 
                        in partnership with 360labs to showcase the companies' susteinable mission to investors and clients. Later,

                    <p> 
                        Lucas had the idea to share a personal experience to emotionally touch the investors. He once travelled to Chapada dos Guimaraes -
                        a place with a stunning landscape. However, that natural beauty was being swalloed by farms. Lucas was astonished when he saw an endless green
                        desert filled with cotton and destruction on the edge of the natural park.

                      <p>
                        Lucas accepted the challenge to tell his story. 
                        Among his responsabilities were to lead the team of 4 people in Brazil, write the plot, find proper rental pieces of equipment and take care
                        of documentation to bring some devices to Brazil - the film has a stereoscopic 360 technology, flying shots, underwater shots, shots in tight spaces -
                        find locations to film and get required authorization, find relevant interviewees, plan logistics and schedule, quote hotels, food, and transportation,
                        drive the filming team to the filming location, translate the interviews, and provide feedback to the editor.

                        One of the problems the scientists were facing at Galy was to analyse the cotton fibers. 
                        They could not measure the cells because they were entangling around each other. 
                        A 2D image was not able to analyse overlapping cells. Lucas proposed the 3D scan of the cells analysis - 
                        an extra dimension can provide more information and developed A 3D scan method to obtain the point cloud. 
                        Lucas developed a VR app to visualize and annotate the 3D cell models. 
                        The app shrinked the scientists to a cellular level and enabled the fiber analysis from a close distance. 
                        The next step would be to create an AI to segmentate and measure the fibers.

                          Lucas developed a datalogger that transmited data from a low-cost bioreactor to the cloud.
                          The datalogger used a ESP8266, a thermocouple, a ph meter, and a DO sensor. 
                          The user could configure and calibrate the sensors through a mobile portal. 
                          The system collected data regularly and sent it to the cloud.

                        Lucas graduation thesis - presented at INDUSCON and published by IEEE - is an automation project for bakeries and grocery stores, using the YOLOv4 object detector. 
                        The team developed a self-checkout cashier wherein the client puts a tray with the products underneath a webcam, 
                        and the system returns the total price. To achieve this goal, the group developed some process and protocols, 
                        a user interface, a admin interface, a segmentation algorithm - to automatically segmentate the training data, 
                        and a server to integrate it all. The menu defined for this research was composed by ten items - 
                        coke, guaraná, coxinha, banana, apple, ice tea, choux cream, eclair, cheese bread, and bread - 
                        and the mAP obtained for our test set was 91.52% and 96.25%.

                                    On the first step, the team proposed to scan the negative mold instead of the mouth scanner. 
                                    The research used three distinct methods to scan the mold: a low-cost equipment called Horus that uses photogrametry, 
                                    Xbox Kinect that has a depth camera, and an interferometry scanner. 
                                    The interferometry scanner obtained the best result, followed by the Horus, and Xbox Kinect. 
                                    We concluded that kinect is not suited for scanning small objects. 
                                    During this step, Lucas studied about camera calibration, point cloud processing and visualization, 
                                    and different scanning methods.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Secondly, the resulted point cloud was filtered and concatenated. 
                                    Many diferent scans were performed in different angles in order to avoid any missing detail. 
                                    The ICP algorithm that stitches common features from each sample joined the various point cloud. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Then, two methods tried to reconstruct the surface: marching cubes and poisson. 
                                    Next, normal vectors in each vertex smoothed the reconstructed mesh and a region growing algorithm 
                                    based on the curvature threshold is applied to the mesh to segmentate the teeth. 
                                    The team assumed some heuristics to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. 
                                    For instance, the program re-positioned the teeth to face upwards by calculating the principal components 
                                    of the model and considered that the bottom part of the mesh is the gum.

                        Lucas participated on a coolest mug competition.
                        The mug was made for scientists at the Tissuelabs.
                        Lucas decided to make a hand holding a becker:
                        Lucas scanned a hand using IPhone11; filtered the point cloud;
                        reconstructed the mesh using poisson mesh reconstruction;
                        imported to Fusion360 (CAD) to edit it; 3D printed it (SLA printer);
                        and, finally, glued it to a becker.

                        In 2020, during a hackathon, Lucas and his team worked on a project to solve a Covid related problem.
                        A problem people faced during the pandemic was to avoid crowds when going to the supermarket.
                        The team developed an app to track the amount of people in the supermarket. The app extracted data from google maps API
                        and plotted a map indicating the amount of people in each establishment.
                        The app also predicted the best time and place for a person to go shopping. The algorithm can be found on

                        As a result, the team won the hackathon. Visagio hired Lucas 
                        to work in a newly created project called V360. The product consisted in an automatic receipt of invoices. 
                        Lucas worked on an OCR module to read 
                        invoices in .jpg and .png format. Lucas used Tesseract and region growing segmentation algorithm to separate the 
                        sections of the document.
