                    <h5>Mechatronics Engineer · 
                        Designer · Computational Geometry Expert · Web Developer
                    </h5>
                    <p>
                        What moves me is to design technologies that augment human capabilities and defy the boundaries of what seems possible. 
                        I graduated in mechatronics engineering from USP, interned at the University of Tokyo, 
                        and worked on biotech companies as Galy and Tissuelabs, developing disruptive technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Besides my passion for engineering and design, I am fascinated by geometry. 
                        Geometry is a powerful tool that enables the reconstruction of virtual models of the world. 
                        The virtual world is boundless. With the proper devices, 
                        we can interface it with our reality and create a perception that something magical is happening: 
                        We can digitally model and <b>3D print an organ</b> and save millions of lives; 
                        We can <b>teleport to another world</b> in virtual reality from the comfort of our homes; We can <b>make machines see and think</b> to create applications that make our lives easier
                    </p>

                            Striving to manufacture the first <b>artificial transplantable heart</b>, 
                            we created state-of–the-art organ-on-a-chip models that simulates the physiology and mechanics of real organs. 
                            I had the initiative of start developing these models at TissueLabs. 
                            I designed and tested more than 50 different organ models.
                            
                            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xNT_aEYsuQ">Tissuelabs' video</a>
                            shows some of these models.

                          <div>

                            <p>
                                The model has a 3D microfluidic circuit integrated with a cell culture. 
                                Each channel can simulate blood vessels and other parts of the human body.
                                I created the models based on organs and tissues from the human body 
                                using Fusion360 and scanning techniques to create the organic shapes. For example:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>
                                  The intestine chip is a rugose duct (where digested food pass) wrapped by coil-shaped blood vessel. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The alveoli chip is an air sac wrapped by a dodecahedronal 
                                    network of blood vessels. 
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            </div>
                          <img class="img-modal" src="img/027-chip.jpeg">

                          <div>
                            <p>
                              I applied two different methods to manufacture the models. 
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                    <b>Stereolithography</b>: 
                                    I used photosensitive resin and TissueRay to create complex shapes such as microfluidic systems. 
                                    TissueRay is a bioprinter that has a LCD screen and a raising platform. This printer was designed at TissueLabs and built by me.
                                    I tested different parameters and shapes to ensure the organoids were properly working.
                                    I first tested the models with flexible resin and then with bioinks.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                                I proposed this method as stereolithography cannot produce multiple-material objects.
                                I made a mold and printed with TissueStart the channels in the mold in a solidifying matrix.
                                The mold enables the production of complex surface shapes.
                                And, the extrusion printer can create complex vessel shapes and objects with multiple materials.

                            To create complex shapes such as organ-on-a-chip, we need special 3D printers called bioprinters. 
                            We designed and built <b>TissueStart</b> (an extrusion printer) and <b>TissueRay</b> (stereolithography printer).

                        <p>
                            Besides helping with the mechanical design, 
                            I had a key role to develop a CAM/CAM to interact with the printers and create organ-on-a-chip models. 
                            The software was developed using Javascript and was hosted on the cloud, 
                            eliminating the need to install a software and solving compatibility problems.

                            The <b>CAM software</b> has integration with <b>slic3r</b> and with the <b>3D printer</b>. The user can convert different format 3D models - 
                            stl, obj, ply, etc - into gcode. 
                            The custom CAM enables: the slicing of complex shapes with multiple materials, 
                            the control and calibration of the printer, 
                            real time adjustments during the printing process, and the use of the printer as an automatic pipette.

                          The CAD consisted in 2 simple tools: The first tool can draw the object contour. The second tool draws the vessels' path.
                          The software extrudes the shape formed by the contour and creates channels based on the vessel's path.

                        Lucas was also involved in the development of 3D printers. Lucas proposed improvements to the TissueStart - an extrusion bioprinter - and designed
                        some of the component in TissueRay - a SLA bioprinter.

                        Lucas proposed new 3D printing techniques, such as using a mix of molding with an extrusion 3D printer. The technique
                        enabled the construction of complex geometries with multiple materials.

                        Every year, millions of acres of <b>forests are lost</b> to agriculture. 
                        This widespread destruction not only contributes to a decline in natural diversity, 
                        but also to a drastic <b>climate change</b>. 
                        At Galy, we try to replace extensive land use for producing commodities on large scale 
                        within a compact factory through cellular agriculture.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        To convince investors to join the cause, 
                        we filmed a virtual reality documentary in the 
                        Chapada dos Guimarães national park to <b>teleport</b> them 
                        to one of the most targeted <b>deforestation spot</b> in Brazil.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        During a family trip, when I travelled to Chapada dos Guimarães - 
                        a place with a stunning landscape, I saw the natural beauty being swallowed by farms. 
                        That endless green desert filled with cotton was truly scary. So, 
                        I had the idea to go back there to share this personal experience to <b>emotionally touch the investors</b>. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From this idea, I wrote the plot, took care of the logistics, found relevant interviewees, rented proper equipment for the desired shots,
                        and lead a filming team of 4 people in Brazil. 
                        We used Insta 360 Pro II, a <b>stereoscopic 360 camera</b> that creates an extremely immersive experience. 
                        The video creates an intimate relationship between the viewer and locals from Chapadas 
                        and makes us feel the pain for seeing all the devastation in the middle of that beautiful landscape. 
                        The video had such an impact on investors that, later, 
                        <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkart/2023/07/08/lab-grown-cotton-enters-the-market-with-galy-suzuran-partnership/?sh=63d9c7b81c9f">Forbes</a>

                        One of the problems the scientists were facing at Galy was to analyse the cotton fibers. 
                        They could not measure the cells that were entangling around each other. 
                        A 2D image was not able to analyse overlapping cells and traditional measuring methods would break the artificially elongated cells.

                      <p>
                        I proposed to 3D scan the cells. Besides the scan method, 
                        I developed a VR app to visualize and annotate the 3D cell models. 
                        The app shrunk the scientists to a cell size and <b>transported people to the microscopic world</b>. 
                        The app enabled the fiber analysis from a close distance.

                        During college I joined the computational geometry lab where I researched various computer vision solutions. 
                        My graduation thesis - presented at <b>INDUSCON</b> and published by <b>IEEE</b> - is an <b>automation project for bakeries</b> and grocery stores, using the <b>YOLOv4</b> object detector.

                        Our team developed a self-checkout cashier wherein the client puts a tray with the products underneath a webcam, 
                        and the system returns the total price. To achieve this goal, we developed:

                                    granted me a scholarship to conduct a research on computer vision. 
                                    I developed a teeth scan solution that was presented at <b>SIICUSP</b>. 
                                    Later, I was invited to continue my research at <b>The University of Tokyo</b> (#23 QS ranking, 2019). 
                                    I studied CG, computational geometry, and mesh segmentation in Japan. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The entire research consisted in 5 steps: teeth mold scan, point cloud processing, surface reconstruction, 
                                    mesh processing, and segmentation of the teeth. The research was presented at ICGG and the paper was published
                                    <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347289425_Teeth_Mesh_Segmentation_Through_Curvature_Analysis">here</a>.

                                <p>
                                    On the first step, I scanned a negative mold of the teeth. 
                                    I used three distinct methods: photogrametry (Horus System), 
                                    a depth camera (Xbox Kinect), and an interferometry scanner. 
                                    During this step, I studied about camera calibration, point cloud processing, 
                                    and different scanning methods.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Secondly, my algorithm filtered and concatenated the point cloud. 
                                    I took diferent scans in different angles in order to avoid any missing detail. 
                                    ICP - a function that stitches common features from each sample - joined the various point cloud. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Then, I reconstructed the surface using marching cubes and poisson mesh reconstruction. 
                                    Next, normal vectors in each vertex smoothed the reconstructed mesh and a region growing algorithm 
                                    based on the curvature threshold is applied to the mesh for segmentation.

                        I decided to make a hand holding a becker:
                        I scanned a hand using IPhone11; filtered the point cloud;
                        reconstructed the mesh using poisson mesh reconstruction;
                        imported to Fusion360 (CAD) to edit it; 3D printed it (SLA printer);

                        I developed an app to track the amount of people in the supermarket to help clients avoid crowds and reduce contamination.

                        After winning the Hackathon, I was hired by Visagio to work at a project called V360. 
                        The newly created product was an application of automated receipt of invoice.

                        During the time I worked at V360, I developed an AI module to read the invoices in .jpg and .png format. 
                        I trained Google Tesseract, an OCR neural network, and region growing to segmentate the sections of the receipt.

                                As the government funded 100% of my education, I wanted to return the investment to society. 
                                Thus, during college, I participated in numerous volunteer work: 
                                an elderly care project; a computer usage course; a support for exchange students; 
                                a math, english, and art class for kids; a summer camp for teenagers; etc.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                I <b>co-founded</b> and <b>lead</b> the <b>Maduros project</b>. 
                                Our team regularly went to a <b>nursing house</b> to play songs, talk, and do stimulating activities such as painting, crafting, and games. 
                                Our team also discussed with many experts in the field to understand the best types of activities.

                                    I was an <b>instructor at the Poli Cidada</b> project. 
                                    I taught <b>computer usage</b> basics to USP employees and other people living close to the university. 
                                    The course included how to turn on/off the computer; deal with bugs; navigate the browser; 
                                    use word, power point, excel, and google drive; and avoid virus and malicious programs.

                                    I was also part of <b>iPoli</b>, an international club that <b>helped exchange students</b>. 
                                    Among his responsabilities, I organized events such as welcome day - 
                                    to explain about the university and life in Brazil, a city tour week, a bureaucracy day - 
                                    to help the students with all the needed documents, 
                                    an international night to connect brazilian people to exchange students, parties, trips, 
                                    and lectures with tips of how to pass at an exchange program. 
                                    I also created an HR department to engage members and organize the team.

                                    I spent two months in Barranquilla (Colombia) <b>teaching</b> math, english, and arts to children in a poor community. 
                                    I also helped organizing events at <b>Fundacion Amor Fiel</b>. 
                                    Lastly, I worked as a <b>summer camp staff</b> every january at <b>Acantonavolley</b> (from 2016 to 2019). 
                                    The staff team did games and took care of kids and teenagers.
