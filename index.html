                        I am fascinated to how geometry can recreate our world in the virtual environment and to how humans interact with this 
                        boundless reconstructed space. When we seamlessly interface the virtual to our physical reality, 
                        we unlock the ability to transform our wildest dreams into tangible experiences. 
                        For instance, we can model an organoid in the computer and 3D print it; 
                        we can look at cells in virtual reality and feel like we have shrunk; 
                        and we can see the inside of a car without opening it with X-ray CT.

                        Tissuelabs is a tissue engineering startup. The companies' dream was to manufacture an artificial transplantable heart. 
                        Lucas proposed the first organ-on-a-chip produced by the company using stereolithography 3D printers.
                        Organ-on-a-chip is an organ model used to simulate the activities, mechanics and physiological response of an organ. 
                        The model is composed by a 3D microfluidic circuit integrated to a cell culture. 
                        Each channel can represent blood vessels and other parts of the human body. For instance, a alveoli model is composed by an air sac
                        and a network of blood vessels around the sac.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        Lucas was responsible for designing and testing most of the organ-on-a-chip and microfluidics 3D models at Tissuelabs.
                        He developed more than 50 different models that were used by scientists to conduct experiments and were also used to showcase the equipment
                        capabilities. Some of these models can be seen on the companies' video:

                                The main product at Tissuelabs were 3D printers. Lucas was responsible for developing a software to interact with the printer.
                                The software was developed using javascript and was hosted on a remote server, thus, eliminating the need to install a software 
                                and solving compatibility problems. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The software was integrated to slic3r and to the 3D printer. 
                                The user was able to convert different format 3D models - stl, obj, ply, etc - into gcode.
                                The web app can be used to print with multiple bio inks and even mix different concentration of inks.
        
                                Lucas also adapted the printer to be used as an automatic pipette machine by developing a pipette mode in the software.
        
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                Finally, Lucas developed CAD software to generate organ-on-a-chip 3D models based on a 2D drawing made by the user.
                                The user had 2 tools available for drawing: The first tool was used to draw the contour of the object.
                                The second tool was used to draw the vessels' path.

                                Tissuelabs also produced bioinks. A bioink is composed by an extra-cellular matrix that is extracted from animal and vegetal sources.
                                Lucas developed 2 bioreactors used in the bioink production process. Lucas was also responsible for fixing lab equipment,
                                for instance, bag sealers, magnetic stirrers, bioreactors, autoclave, 3D printers, and centrifuges.

                                Lucas is very goal oriented person and was able to fix an equipment in less than 24 hours after the ticket was opened.
                                Due to his dedication to achieve goals and help his colleagues, he won the congeniality and achiever prize during the third quarter
                                of 2021, for being voted the best employees and for achieving more goals respectively.

                        Galy is a cellular agriculture company. Cell agg can produce differente plant culture using less water, energy, land, and chemicals.
                        The company wanted to convey an urgency feeling to investors to convince
                        them to join the cause. Lucas co-produced a VR video and filmed the documentary in the Chapada dos Guimaraes national park 
                        in partnership with 360labs to showcase the companies' susteinable mission to investors and clients.
                        The video was later published on 
                        <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkart/2023/07/08/lab-grown-cotton-enters-the-market-with-galy-suzuran-partnership/?sh=63d9c7b81c9f">forbes</a>.

                        Lucas had the idea to share a personal experience to emotionally touch the investors. He, once travelled to Chapada dos Guimaraes.
                        A place with a stunning landscape. However, that natural beauty was being swalloed by farms. Lucas was astonished when he saw an endless green
                        desert filled with cotton and destruction on the edge of the natural park.

                        Among Lucas's responsabilities were to lead the team of 4 people in Brazil, write the plot, find proper rental pieces of equipment and take care
                        of documentation to bring some devices to Brazil - the film has a stereoscopic 360 technology, has flying shots, underwater shots, shots in tight spaces 
                        (required a wide variety of equipment), find locations to film and get required authorization, find relevant interviewees, plan logistics and schedule, quote hotels, food, and transportation,
                        drive the filming team to the filming location, translate the interviews, and provide feedback to the editor.

                        One of the problems the scientists were facing at Galy was to analyse the cotton fibers.
                        They could not measure the cells because they were entangling around each other.
                        A 2D image was not able to analyse overlapping cells. Lucas proposed to analyse a 3D scan of the cells.
                        An extra dimension can provide more information to the analysis.

                        A 3D scan technique was developed to scan the cells. Lucas developed a VR app to visualize and annotate the 
                        3D cell models. The app shrinked the scientists to a cellular level and enabled the fiber analysis from a close distance.
                        The next step would be to create an AI to segmentate and measure the fibers.

                          A datalogger that transmited data from a low-cost bioreactor to the cloud was developed.
                          The datalogger used a ESP8266, a thermocouple, a ph meter, and a DO sensor.
                          A mobile app was developed to configure and calibrate the sensors. The system collected data regularly and sent it to the cloud.
                          The data can be accessed via a website that plotted the data in a chart.

                            Galy had dozens of employees working in a production line to cultivate plant cells.
                            Most scientists were frustrated for having to perform a highly repetitive work.
                            Lucas designed an automation platform to optimize lab processes.

                        Lucas graduation thesis is an automation project for bakeries and grocery stores, using the YOLOv4 object detector. 
                        A self-checkout cashier was developed where the client puts a tray with the products underneath a webcam, 
                        and the system returns the total price of the purchase. 
                        To achieve this goal, it was developed some process and protocols, a user interface, a admin interface,
                        a segmentation algorithm - to automatically segmentate the training data, 
                        and a server to integrate it all. The menu defined for this research was composed by 10 items - 
                        coke, guaraná, coxinha, banana, apple, ice tea, choux cream, eclair, cheese bread, and bread - 
                        and the mAP obtained for our test set was 91.52% and 96.25%, when all requisites were respected. 
                        The research was presented at INDUSCON and published by IEEE
                        <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9529909">(the paper)</a>.

                                    Later, Lucas was invited to continue his research at The University of Tokyo (#23 QS ranking, 2019). Lucas studied CG, computational geometry,
                                    and mesh segmentation during his time in Japan. 
                                
                                    The entire research consisted in 5 steps: teeth mold scan, point cloud processing, surface reconstruction, mesh processing, 
                                    and segmentation of the teeth. The research was presented at ICGG and the paper was published

                                    On the first step, Instead of scanning the mouth, Lucas proposed to scan the negative mold. 
                                    3 different methods were used to scan the mold. We used a low-cost equipment called horus that uses photogrametry.
                                    We used kinect that has a depth camera. We used a interferometry scanner. The interferometry scanner obtained the best result,
                                    followed by the horus, and kinect. We concluded that kinect is not suited for scanning small objects.
                                    During this step, Lucas studied about camera calibration,
                                    point cloud processing and visualization, and different scanning methods.

                                    Secondly, the resulted point cloud was filtered and concatenated. Many diferent scans were performed in different angles in order
                                    to avoid missing any detail. To join the various point cloud together an algorithm called ICP was used. The algorithm tries to find
                                    common charateristic features in each sample to stitch them together.

                                    Then, the mesh is reconstructed. 2 methods were tested: marching cubes and poisson. The reconstructed mesh is smoothed by calculating
                                    the normal vectors. A region growing based on the curvature threshold is applied to the mesh to segmentate the teeth.
                                    Some heuristics were assumed in order to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. For instance, we re-positioned the teeth to face upwards
                                    by calculating the principal components of the model.

                        The mug was made for scientists at the Tissuelabs.
                        Lucas decided to make a hand holding a becker:
                        Lucas scanned a hand using IPhone11; filtered the point cloud;
                        reconstructed the mesh using poisson mesh reconstruction;
                        imported to Fusion360 (CAD) to edit it; 3D printed it (SLA printer);
                        and, finally, glued it to a becker.

                        In 2020, during a hackathon, Lucas and his team worked on a project to solve a Covid related problem.
                        A problem people faced during the pandemic was to avoid crowds when going to the supermarket.
                        Lucas developed an app to track the amount of people in each supermarket by using a google maps API.
                        The app also predicted the best time and place for a person to go shopping and plotted a map indicating 
                        the amount of people in each establishment. The algorithm can be found on

                        As a result, Lucas and his team won the hackathon. Lucas was hired to work for Visagio in a newly created project
                        called V360. The product consisted in automatic receipt of invoices. Lucas worked on an OCR module to read 
                        invoices in .jpg and .png format. Lucas used Tesseract and region growing segmentation algorithm to separate each 
                        section of the document.

                                As his education was completely funded by the government, Lucas wanted to do something in return
                                to society. His most relevant work includes: a project for the elderly's psicomotor stimulus;
                                a basic computer usage course for the community around USP; a support for foreign students and 
                                Brazilian student who wanted to study abroad; a math, english and art class for kids in a poor community;
                                and a summer camp for teenagers.
